# Financial-Analysis-of-S-P500-stocks

The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&P 500, is a stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on exchanges in the United States. 
It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices. As of December 31, 2020, more than $5.4 trillion was invested in assets tied to the performance of the index. 
In this project, we will try to understand the dataset, analyse it, and perform data visualizations using various Python libraries to find patterns and insights within the dataset. 

Following are all possible pairplots with exchanges highlighted in different colors:
